# read-only-external
external cs:go cheat with only a read handle.

i wrote this for a kid that just wanted to get to global fast. keep in mind, if good code is pizza, this is rotten eggs.

it uses gdi to draw, anyone in the right mind should hook endscene.
take a look at the code before usage. and please, do not try your luck if you don't know what you're doing.

at the time of upload, 3/5/23, overwatch is down and you can cheat pretty blatantly with this and not get banned/stay in green trust.
more reasons to switch over to valorant like i did :^)

it utilizes lazyimporter/xor'd strings. has a "magnetic" triggerbot, gdi esp, and an aimbot that i just couldnt get to work with the fucking triggerbot. i know it's terrible, but it is basically an unpolished version of what you can do most with externals/without writing to game memory.
